# README

this script extracts highlights of pdfs into markdown format. this has helped me when studying, marking things directly on the pdf and then exporting the text to markdown. Some characters do not get recognized correctly and there is definitely place for imporvement, but for me it works. 

> This script was coded using Claude AI.

## Installation

Clone the git repository and follow the steps in the setup.md. If you are using a mac and have problems with your python installation, you can use pyenv as a python version manager.

## Usage

Call the script with the path of the pdf as an argument and it prints every highlighted text including the text of the paragraph in which the highlighted text is (so you also get the context of the highlighted text). if you call the script without any arguments you get a description of the other optional arguments.
